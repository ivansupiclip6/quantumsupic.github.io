I mostly work on the verification and quantification of non-classical resources. Among many different quantum resources, I am particularly interested in different types of nonlocality and quantum incompatibility. Furthermore, I am interested in the way geometry influences nonlocal effects, particularly in quantum networks, and different ways to use such effects in quantum information processing protocols. Check my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=fr&user=rPJDaXwAAAAJ) to see the list of my publications my publications.
